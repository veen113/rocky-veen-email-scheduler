## API Endpoints

### Instagram Routes
- `POST /api/instagram/search` - Search for business accounts
- `GET /api/instagram/account/:username` - Get detailed account information

### Email Routes
- `POST /api/email/find` - Find email for a company
- `POST /api/email/verify` - Verify an email address
- `POST /api/email/bulk-find` - Find emails for multiple companies

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `HUNTER_API_KEY` - Your Hunter.io API key (required)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)
- `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` - Rate limiting (default: 60)

### Rate Limiting
The app includes built-in rate limiting to respect API quotas:
- Instagram searches are limited to avoid detection
- Email API calls are spaced out to prevent rate limiting
- Hunter.io free tier: 50 requests/month

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Hunter.io API key not configured"**
   - Make sure you've added your API key to the `.env` file
   - Restart the server after adding the key

2. **Instagram search returns no results**
   - Try different keywords or broader terms
   - Some niches may have fewer business accounts
   - Instagram may temporarily block requests (try again later)

3. **Puppeteer fails to launch**
   - Install Chrome/Chromium browser
   - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser`
   - On macOS: Chrome should be installed automatically

4. **No emails found**
   - Company names may not have associated domains
   - Try searching with different company name variations
   - Some businesses may not have public email addresses

### Performance Tips

- Start with smaller result sets (10-20 accounts)
- Use specific niche keywords for better targeting
- Process emails in batches to avoid rate limits
- Export results regularly to avoid losing data

## API Limits

### Hunter.io Free Tier
- 50 requests per month
- 25 email verifications per month
- Upgrade for higher limits

### Instagram
- No official API for this use case
- Web scraping has inherent limitations
- Respect rate limits to avoid temporary blocks
